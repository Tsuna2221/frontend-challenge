Resources, tooling, and design guidelines for building websites with Elo UI, the web incarnation of the [Plurall Design System](https://plurall.net).

## Introduction

Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of Plurall websites, while providing a consistent user experience to our end users. In addition, the design system and component library should be easy to use and developer and designer-friendly.

This style guide is living documentation that will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our design system.
