Resources, tooling, and design guidelines for building websites with Elo UI, the web incarnation of the [Plurall](https://plurall.net) Design System.

<Button onClick={(e) => window.location.href = '/storybook/'}>Open Storybook</Button>

## Introduction
Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of Plurall websites, while providing a consistent user experience to our end users. In addition, the design system and component library should be easy to use and developer and designer-friendly.

This style guide is living documentation that will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our design system.
